          <h2>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Katya Little, a student in the
            <a
              href="https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/academic-information/departments-programs/growth-structure-cities"
            >
              Growth and Structure of Cities department</a
            >
            at Bryn Mawr College. This website and the maps on it are my final
            project for the Spring 2024 CITY B328: Applied GIS Projects class,
            taught by Professor Jennifer Hurley, which was structured around the
            execution of a semester-long independent Geographic Information
            Systems (GIS) project using ArcGIS Pro.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is intended to act as an archive showcasing the results
            of my GIS analysis, which focused on locating and analyzing the
            distribution of potential greyfields--what I define for the purposes
            of this analysis as
            <i
              >abandoned and/or underutilized retail, industrial, and other
              non-residential property with high impermeable surface cover</i
            ><sup
              ><a href="#footnote1" id="ref1" title="Jump to footnote"
                >[1]</a
              ></sup
            >--located in Fairfax, Virginia (both Fairfax County and the city of
            Fairfax).
          </p>
          <p>
            The content available on the website and my analysis is directed
            primarily toward planners and community organizers in the area
            interested in investing in community redevelopment as well as
            researchers interested in the study and/or cataloguing of greyfield
            properties using GIS; however, I hope it may prove useful or
            interesting for others!
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would like to take a comprehensive look at the entire project
            by moving through the website after reading this initial "About"
            page, I recommend doing so in the following order.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>"Process"</b>, which contains a data dictionary for the
              project, a list of data sources, a description of my process of
              indentifying potential greyfield sites, and an evaluation of my
              method's accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>"Findings"</b>, a summary of the primary findings of the
              project.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>"Exploration"</b>, which contextualizes the findings of the
              project by providing further analysis of the distribution of
              identified parcels throughout the county.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>"Reflections"</b>, a series of reflections both the limitations
              and potential expansions to the analysis as well as challenges I
              faced during the project, things I learned, and sub-sections of
              the project I undertook, but ended up scrapping.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To illustrate my findings, I have included various interactive maps
            of them created using ArcGIS Online.
