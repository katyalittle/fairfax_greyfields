      Because I have the map itself (i.e. I've identified the potential greyfield parcels and they are in separate layers) and I'm working on the Map Viewer later, I haven't changed the layer names for readability. In the map viewer, you can click them to hide or show different layers. Here is a guide to their names:
      <ul>
        <li>parcels_ONLYsewer = Non-residential parcels with sewer available, but not connected; they have no data for water or gas connection. They have an impervious surface cover of greater than 15%</li>
        <li>parcels_ONLYwatersewer =  Non-residential parcels with water and sewer available, but not connected; they have no data for gas connection. They have an impervious surface cover of greater than 15%</li>
        <li>parcels_ONLYwater =  Non-residential parcels with water available, but not connected; they have no data for sewer or gas connection. They have an impervious surface cover of greater than 15%</li>
        <li>parcels_ALLavailable = Non-residential parcels with water, sewer, and gas available, but not connected. They have impervious surface area of greater than 15%</li>
        <li>parcels_impervious = Non-residential parcels with an impervious surface cover of greater than 15% (this is the point where, according to the EPA, <a href="https://enviroatlas.epa.gov/enviroatlas/DataFactSheets/pdf/ESN/Percstreamw15percentimperviousin30meters.pdf">nearby water quality will be damaged</a>)</li>
        <li>parcels = Non-residential parcels</li>
      </ul>
