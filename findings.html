          <h2>PROJECT FINDINGS: POTENTIAL GREYFIELDS</h2>
          <p>
            Below are the primary findings of this project: a map of potential
            greyfield parcels in Fairfax, Virginia best suited for redevelopment
            due to their proximity to block groups that could benefit the most
            from it. There was a fairly wide spread of types of properties that
            were ultimately identified as the best candidates for redevelopment,
            but the most common type of property identified was neighborhood
            retail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The base map with every layer used for analysis is available on
            ArcGIS online and can be accessed for viewing and download
            <a href="https://arcg.is/0y55na">here</a>. A data dictionary
            defining variables used in the analysis can be downloaded
            <a href="greyfields_datadictionary.xlsx">here</a>. For a more
            in-depth, step-by-step description of the analysis process that lead
            to these findings, go to the <a href="process.html">Process</a> page
            of this website.

              Some notes on the map below and how to navigate it:
              <ul>
                <li>You can click on specific map features in order to display a pop-up listing the data the feature contains.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Due to the amount of data utilized over the course of the project, many features have more fields than are defined in the data dictionary. All fields that were used in the analysis process are listed with sources in the data dictionary above; fields that are not listed in the data dictionary were not used in the analysis.</li>
                  <li>Because the data from the project was primarily taken from the Fairfax County Open Data Portal or the American Community Survey, those curious about any fields not defined can locate them in the sources cited in the data dictionary. All fields not found in the data dictionary or the sources attached--for example, shape length and width measures--were generated in the analysis process.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>View map legends and toggle the visibility of different layers by clicking them in the legend.</li>
                <li>The parcels are organized into layers by combinations of availability and null values in their the three utility categories I used to identify underuse--sewer, water, and gas. Layer titles detail which utilities were available and which had no data available for the parcel's connection (indicated by a null value): for example, the "Only water available" layer contains parcels for which water was listed as available but not connected, while gas and sewer contained null values signifying a lack of data.</li>
              </ul>
