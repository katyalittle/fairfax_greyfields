          <h2>PROJECT FINDINGS: POTENTIAL GREYFIELDS</h2>
          <p>
            Below are the primary findings of this project: a map of potential
            greyfield parcels in Fairfax, Virginia best suited for redevelopment
            due to their proximity to block groups that could benefit the most
            from it. There was a fairly wide spread of types of properties that
            were ultimately identified as the best candidates for redevelopment,
            but the most common type of property identified was neighborhood
            retail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The base map with every layer used for analysis is available on
            ArcGIS online and can be accessed for viewing and download
            <a href="https://arcg.is/0y55na">here</a>. A data dictionary
            defining variables used in the analysis can be downloaded
            <a href="greyfields_datadictionary.xlsx">here</a>. For a more
            in-depth, step-by-step description of the analysis process that lead
            to these findings, go to the <a href="process.html">Process</a> page
            of this website.
          </p>
          <p>Some notes on the map's organization and how to navigate it:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You can click on specific parcels to see their attributes as well
              as hide and show different layers by clicking them in the legend.
            </li>
            <li>
              The parcels are organized into layers by combinations of
              availability and null values in their the three utility categories
              I used to identify underuse--sewer, water, and gas. Layer titles
              detail which utilities were available and which had no data
              available for the parcel's connection (indicated by a null value):
              for example, the "Only water available" layer contains parcels for
              which water was listed as available but not connected, while gas
              and sewer contained null values signifying a lack of data.
              <ul>
                <li id="sublist">
                  Only four combinations of utility connection-no data values
                  were present in the parcel data.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
