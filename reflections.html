              As I mentioned on the Process page, the methods and data feasibly
              available to research greyfield properties--especially to an
              undergraduate student--are fairly <b>limited</b>!
            </p>
            <p>
              In the social sciences, a couple of decades isn't a terribly long
              time. As a result, for all intents and purposes, the concept of a
              greyfield was introduced to the urban planning consciousness
              fairly recently. This meant that there wasn't a large body of
              literature or policy history relating to them that I could use for
              preliminary research, and that wasn't a consistent definition of
              what, exactly, a greyfield <i>is</i> out there for me to use to
              define variables. Thus, the basic criteria for a greyfield were
              defined by myself, with the help of Professor Hurley and Lee
              Sobel, the author of <i>Greyfields into Goldfields</i> and a
              professional to whom this project owes an enormous debt. While I
              took pains to be precise with the criteria, they are ultimately
              only an approximation of a larger set of constantly-evolving
              definitions.
            </p>
            <p>
              My criteria and the subject of the project--Fairfax County and
              City--were also heavily influenced by the data available to me.
              Greyfields as an idea hinge on the underuse of land, which is a
              slippery concept to define and even harder to document. First, it
              carries the assumption that land is something to fundamentally be
              used for something "productive", which necessitates its own
              debate; however, this assumption is absolutely crucial to the
              planning field. Secondly, it's very difficult to draw lines around
              "underuse": what counts as underuse, how do you tell if land meets
              criteria, and how long must underuse continue to necessitate some
              kind of intervention to return a piece of land to use, if
              intervention is necessary or right at all? Due to these more
              abstract considerations as well as concerns about the privacy of
              landowners and the sheer amount of money, technology, and manpower
              it would take to keep records about land underuse or abandonment,
              it's <i>extremely</i> difficult to find any kind of solid
              quantitative record of whether or not a piece of land is, in fact,
              being used to some degree. Utility shutoffs were my closest
              approximation of a criterion that, in many cases, approximates
              active abandonment of a property more than just underuse. On top
              of this, the frequency of unavailable data in utility connection
              tends to reduce its reliability--after all, there is a chance
              those null values stood in place of a utility that was, in fact,
              connected. Additionally, I specifically chose Fairfax as the
              subject of my research due to the county and city's remarkable
              data transparency and the level of detail in geospatial data they
              make available to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              The logistics of data management over the course of the project
              were not only a constant headache for me, but also an example of
              the way data transfer can limit data organization and cause
              errors. A lost record or mismatched file can spell doom for a
              researcher trying to make sure their results are as accurate and
              transparent as possible, and this was a common problem that forced
              me to stop research and re-do analysis steps while I data cleaned,
              joined tables, organized files across different storage locations,
              and transformed data into a variety of formats several times over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, some statistical mishaps occurred due to human
              error! When weighting block groups using the Suitaibility Index, I
              failed to consider that most of the variables I was using (listed
              in step 4 of the Process page) are highly correlated.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a result of the above limitations, my method wasn't 100%
              accurate (you can find more details on this at the bottom of the
              Process page) and is more than open to improvement from others
              seeking to take another look at greyfields in Fairfax or other
              areas.

              There are many different <b>future directions</b> in which this
              project could have gone if I'd had more time. With the opportunity
              to take a more in-depth look at the subject of greyfields, I
              likely would've made the following part of my project.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                An expansion of scale, taking a look at other suburban counties
                in Virginia and the United States.
              </li>
              <li>
                The incorporation of satellite imagery into analysis by using
                machine learning tools to indicate potential greyfield
                properties identified in orthoimagery.
              </li>
              <li>
                Addition of different network analysis problem sets into my
                primary analysis in order to tailor the project to more
                audiences with potential greyfield property selection criteria
                driven by interests other than nonprofit community development,
                such as property developers.
              </li>
              <li>
                More in-depth analysis of greyfield distribution using a wider
                variety of demographic variables from the Census and other
                sources.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Because I didn't have the opportunity myself, I invite anyone
              interested to take those directions!

              It's impossible to overstate how much I <b>learned</b> by doing

              While I still learned something valuable during every wrong turn I
              took, there were some very notable <b>wrong turns</b> over the
              course of the project that ultimately didn't feature in the final
              analysis:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                an attempt to use deep learning to identify potential greyfield
                properties using empty parking lots via a lack of cars on the
                property indicating lack of use (scrapped due to issues with the
                download of ESRI's Deep Learning Libraries, the accuracy of the
                model, chance that cars simply weren't on the property at the
                time the orthoimage was taken);
              </li>
              <li>
                an attempt to use deep learning to identify impermeable surface
                from orthoimagery more recent than the 2017 Impermeable Surface
                data available from the county (scrapped due to issues with the
                download of Esri's Deep Learning Libraries and glitches blocking
                use of the Classification Wizard)
              </li>
              <li>
                an attempt to create a network dataset of my own using
                OpenStreetMap data before figuring out how to use credits to use
                the ArcGIS Online network dataset, resulting in a 2-week fight
                with, in order:
              </li>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Importing shapefiles from BBBike Extracts of the OSM network

                in the county (scrapped due to lack of access to the Niche API

              Additionally, apart from all of the things listed above that went
              wrong, there were many other challenges I faced over the course of
              the project.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I went into January without a mentor and several different
                possible projects in mind; that meant a lot of time that
                could've been used to get started with a project was spent
                brainstorming and outlining goals that I could've already had in
                mind at the beginning of the semester.
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm happy with the skills I learned through the creation of this
                website, but I wish I hadn't made it the vehicle for my final
                product: it was extremely time-consuming to make, as I had never
                made a website using HTML and CSS before, and I wish I had spent
                that time on polishing my data and other sub-projects that
                developed my GIS analysis skills instead of the
                <i>presentation</i> of my analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                I only started taking notes on the operations I used in the
                analysis and key variables in each dataset halfway and a third
                of the way through the semester respectively, which meant I had
                to spend some time digging through my ArcGIS Pro history in
                order to piece together things I had done and later forgotten
                for the Process page and Data Dictionary.
              </li>
              <li>
                This class was taken concurrently with other very
                labor-intensive self-directed classes, which made this semester
                a crash course in time management.
              </li>
              <li>
                To top everything off, ArcGIS Online doesn't allow you to
                represent the levels of your data in percentages. I hope you
                enjoy the decimals.

            <p>
              Despite these challenges, I'm ultimately very pleased with the
              progress I made over the course of the semester and am very
              grateful that I had the opportunity to take the class!
